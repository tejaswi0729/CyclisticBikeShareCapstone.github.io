Welcome to the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study! In this case study, I have performed some real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. I have worked for a 
fictional company, Cyclistic, and met different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions

## Cyclistic

A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles,
and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who canâ€™t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for 
traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

I have documented all the steps followed to find a marketing strategy to maximize the number of annual Memberships by converting casual riders into annual members
